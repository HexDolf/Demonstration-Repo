    <h1>What is Intelligence?</h1>
    <h2>Intelligence is one's ability to embody a state of mind with qualities associated with intelligence.</h2>
    <h1>Do we feel intelligence?
    </h1>
    <h2>Yes, suprisingly, we do.</h2>
    <h1>How?</h1>
    <h3>Well, state of mind is correlated to an energy state!</h3>
    <h6>Low energy state of mind unoxidized from improper breathing with disturbed biorythm due to bad thoughts will be in a state of mind of low intelligence, narrow consciousness/autopilot and surely isn't going to come up with a billion dollar idea,</h6>
    <h6> so to begin with we need to develop a high energy state which will result with high intelligence and a expanded conciousness state of mind. </h6>
    <h6>People at a low energy state seek attention in such a way that they guess the most triggerful emotional responses of others to forcefully manipulate and start an interaction in which they suck on their energy state. This is called Vampirism</h6>
    <h6>The only way not to get sucked by energy vampires is to be in a state of energy overflow, where you can give the energy unconditionally and still be in a "full cup" energy state.</h6>
    <h6>Otherwise, you are bound to stay unconcious, suck and be sucked.</h6>
    <h2>This following concept does not present itself to people, it is understood only from a state of mind of high energy/full cup, with certain rules set </h2>
    <h3>What you believe is true and or believe is possible is the building material of the current state of mind. </h3>
    <h3>Seek and you shall find - works, but only in limits of what you believe in</h3>
    <h3>This something called "sffgdhbdfgfsgfdghed" and it doesn't exist until you believe it to be</h3>
    <h3>High energy state of mind wishes it to be and notices immidiately that it is.</h3>
    <h3>Low energy state of mind wishes it to be, doesn't believe it is therefore notices that it isn't and proceeds unconciously the habitual loading of old beliefs. </h3>
    <h3>To change what you believe is true is to change a reality, and to change realities is to build realities, and to build realities is to be in a creator state of mind.
    <h3></h3> From the point of ALL the things(patterns) you believe are true, your reality is formed.
    <h3>Due to seek and you shall find, you can't find what you don't first seek and we could imagine that reality is in a superposition until your belief is decided.</h3>
    <h3>As you go through lower to higher energy states, you will be experiencing changes from feeling like a small human in a big world to feeling like a big world in a small human, from out of place all the way to just feeling focused in flow jumping accros places that you are, from closedness and stiffnes to ease and fluidity. </h3>
    <h4>Emotions are real time representations of energy levels.</h4>
    <h4>The better we feel at a particular moment of now, the closer we are to who we should be.</h4>
    <h4>We feel bad when we lose ourselves in a series of low energy state states of mind.</h4>
    <h4>Energy levels determine thoughts</h4>
    <h4>Thoughts determine heart rythm and expressions</h4>
    <h4>Expressions determine emotions</h4>
    <h4>Emotions drive action</h4>
    <h4>Actions provide results</h4>
    <h4>Results cause reactions</h4>
    <h4>All costs attention</h4>
    <h4>Attention lives on energy</h4>

    <h5>We feel someone is intelligent when we subconciously compare their energy state fluctuations with our own.</h5>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h4>State of minds get embodied by other states of mind.</h4>
    <h5>with the S.O.M. change being unnoticable due to always being the state of mind in the moment of now.</h5>
    <h6>changing fast or slow depending on high or low levels of empathy. </h4></h6>
is true because you believe it is true</h2>
    <h1 class="title">I say it to be, then I am, then it is</h1>    <h1>Imagine!</h1>
    <h2>Imagine a state of mind where everything you believe is true,

        The element inside the container can be adjusted and centered and moved around easily.
