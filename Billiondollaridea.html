    <h4>Idea is to create a wallet with new own currency called Iliif</h4>
    <h4>1 Iliif = 1g gold</h4> 
    <h3> Iliif is a digital network which allows people to connect and 
        communicate with other people with the same amount of money in their Iliif wallet.</h3>
    <h3>People around the world get to keep their money in gold through Ilif, which they use to connect with other people with similar net worth.</h3>

    <h3>I need you to: _ </h3>

    <h3>You pay any amount you want to share the post, in what circular km area you will share the post, and according to the ratio of your worth and the amount paid, 1% of full net worth+0.01xamount of people a spectre of classes of people will recieve it in the news feed</h3>
    <h3>and vote for it to prevent automatically losing money with a deadline of 6 months</h3>
    <h3></h3>
    <h3>Your money is public, while you are anonymous</h3>
    <h3>You can choose to talk to same classes, donate to lower classes people, recieve donations from higher class people,
        Use donations to post about what you wish to change, recieve and donate to posts.
    </h3>
